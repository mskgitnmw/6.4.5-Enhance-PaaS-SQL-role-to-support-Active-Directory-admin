# 6.4.5-Enhance-PaaS-SQL-role-to-support-Active-Directory-admin
Paas SQL role is already created (6.4.5 azure-role-mssql-master.zip) we should able to authenticate with AD credentials (Individual & Group), Refer PaaS Sql AD Admin.PNG
ExportedTemplate-sai-lab.zip, is the ARM template that creates the Paas SQL with AD credentials (individual), Now we should modify the 6.4.5 azure-role-mssql-master.zip file in order to authenticate with (individual & group) AD credentials.
